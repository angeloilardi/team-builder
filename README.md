## Installation

Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies

## Usage

Run the app using the command run `node index.js` and answer all the questions regarding the team, starting from the manager. 

After entering the manager information, more members of the team can be added (either engineers or interns). 

Once there are no team memebers left to enter, a web page displaying all of the team's information will be created. 

Look for the 'index.html' file located in the 'output' folder. 

If you'd like to have a look at what the page looks like, check the file in the sample folder or click [here](./sample/team.html).
